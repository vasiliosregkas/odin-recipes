    <h1>Simple Pasta Carbonara</h1>
    <img src="../Pictures/pasta-carbonara.jpg.webp" alt="Beautiful Carbonara" height="400px" width="500px">
    <p>With crispy bits of pork, a peppery bite, and a velvety cheese sauce enriched with eggs, carbonara is just<br> 
        as easy to make for dinner as it is at 2 a.m. after a long night out. It’s one of Rome’s signature dishes,<br> 
        and just like cacio e pepe and other pasta recipes in that class, its simplicity demands proper technique<br> 
        and quality ingredients. Cured meat adds a salty depth to the dish, and while guanciale is the most<br> 
        traditional choice, diced pancetta or bacon also work well. Egg yolks give the carbonara sauce its<br> 
        luscious texture and golden hue, so pick up farm-fresh eggs if you can. And when it comes to the cheese<br> 
        and pasta, this is the time to spend a little extra: Buy a wedge of Romano cheese or real Parmigiano<br> 
        Reggiano and a nice box of spaghetti, bucatini, or rigatoni.
    </p>
    <p>
        A word on technique: To achieve the creamy sauce’s signature sheen, adding the ingredients at just the<br> 
        right time and temperature is key for any carbonara recipe. Whisking a quarter cup of hot pasta water<br> 
        into the raw egg mixture and turning off the heat before adding it to the pasta helps bring everything<br> 
        together into a glossy, emulsified sauce without overcooking the yolks. From there, toss everything<br>
        together quickly and add more pasta cooking water to thin the sauce as needed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At dinner this pasta dish is nice served alongside a plate of greens, but when you’re in the throes of an<br> 
        after-hours hang, just grab a fork.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>4 servings</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3Tbsp. kosher salt, plus more</li>
        <li>4oz. guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl), pancetta (Italian bacon), or bacon</li>
        <li>2oz. Parmesan or Pecorino Romano</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1lb. spaghetti, bucatini, or rigatoni</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 6 qt. water in a large pot over high. When water starts to steam, add 3 Tbsp. salt and cover pot<br> 
            with a lid (this will bring water to a boil faster).</li>

        <li>While you are waiting on the water, do a little prep. Remove 4 oz. guanciale from packaging and cut<br> 
            into about 1x¼" strips. Finely grate 2 oz. cheese and set aside one-quarter of cheese for later.</li>
        
        <li>Whisk 4 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs in a medium bowl until no streaks remain, then stir in remaining<br> 
            grated cheese. Add several cranks of pepper and set aside.</li>
        
        <li>Working next to pot, heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add<br> 
            guanciale and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp around the edges, 7–10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Remove pot from heat. Using a wooden spoon, fish out guanciale and transfer to a small bowl. Pour fat<br> 
            into a heatproof measuring cup, then add back about 3 Tbsp. to pot. Discard any remaining fat.</li>

        <li>Cook 1 lb. pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes shy of package instructions. Just<br> 
            before pasta is finished, scoop out 1¾ cups pasta cooking liquid with same heatproof measuring cup.</li>

        <li>Add 1 cup reserved pasta cooking liquid to Dutch oven and bring to a boil over medium-high. Drain<br> 
            pasta in a colander, then transfer to Dutch oven.</li>

        <li>Cook pasta, stirring constantly and vigorously, until al dente and water is reduced by about half, about 2<br> 
            minutes. Remove pot from heat.</li>

        <li>Whisk ¼ cup reserved pasta water into egg mixture, then very slowly stream into Dutch oven, stirring<br> 
            constantly, until cheese is melted and egg is thickened to form a glossy sauce. Season with salt, if<br> 
            needed. Thin sauce with remaining ½ cup pasta cooking liquid, adding a tablespoonful at a time, until<br> 
            it's the consistency of heavy cream (you most likely won’t use all of it).</li>

        <li>Mix in guanciale and divide pasta among bowls. Top with pepper and reserved cheese.</li>
    </ol>
