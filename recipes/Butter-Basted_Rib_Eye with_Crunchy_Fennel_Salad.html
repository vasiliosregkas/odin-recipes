    <p>Rich marbled meats are extra-delicious when served with cool,<br>
        crunchy, acidic vegetables. It's a fact, and the combo never gets old.<br>
        Bone-in strip steak or a T-bone are great choices here too.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>3-4 Servings</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2"-thick bone-in rib eye steak (about 2 lb.)</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
            <li>4 Gralic cloves, 3 mashed, 1 finely grated</li>
            <li>2-3 sprigs rosemary</li>
            <li>oil-packed anchovy fillets,finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>2 fennel bulbs, woody tops trimmed</li>
            <li>Aleppo-style pepper (for serving)</li>
            <li>Flaky sea salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">If you think of it in advance, season steak all over with kosher salt and pepper. Chill, uncovered, at least<br> 
                2 hours and up to 2 days. If not, season now and proceed.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">Heat a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-high 2 minutes. Drizzle in enough oil to evenly coat pan<br> 
                with no bald spots and cook steak, turning every 2–3 minutes, until a dark crust forms on both sides and<br> 
                steak is very rare (a thermometer inserted dead center should register 115°), 12–15 minutes. Frequent<br> 
                turning will develop a gorgeous crust without creating thick strips of well-cooked steak beneath the<br> 
                surface.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">Reduce heat to medium; add butter, smashed garlic, and rosemary. Tilt skillet toward you and scoot<br> 
                steak to the far end of pan so that garlic and rosemary slide down into the foaming butter. Holding the<br> 
                skillet’s handle with your nondominant hand, spoon butter over steak repeatedly, 1–2 minutes (internal<br> 
                temperature should hit 120° for medium-rare). Transfer steak to a platter and let rest 15 minutes for<br> 
                juices to redistribute.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">Meanwhile, whisk together grated garlic, anchovies, and vinegar in a medium bowl; season with kosher<br> 
                salt. Whisk in ⅓ cup oil, then taste and season with more kosher salt and some pepper. The dressing<br> 
                should be punchy and acidic.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">Cut stalks away from fennel bulb. Remove tough outer layer from bulb, then halve lengthwise. Cut out<br> 
                core. Set cut side down and slice crosswise ¼" thick, then slice stalks and fronds, which will give the<br> 
                salad a range of textures. Add fennel to bowl with dressing and toss to coat.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">Cut steak away from bone and slice against the grain ½" thick. Season with some Aleppo-style pepper<br> 
                and sea salt; drizzle with oil. Serve with fennel salad alongside and the bone, too, of course.
            </li>
        </ol>
