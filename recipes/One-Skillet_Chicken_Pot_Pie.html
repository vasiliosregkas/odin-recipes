    <h1>One-Skillet Chicken Pot Pie</h1>
    <img src="../Pictures/Basically-Chicken-Pot-Pie-01.jpg.webp" alt="Delicious Chicken Pot Pie" height="400" width="500">
    <p>This recipe for homemade chicken pot pie from Molly Baz (watch her make it) uses two major<br>
        shortcuts: The first is using shredded chicken from a rotisserie bird instead of cooking boneless chicken<br>
        breasts or thighs. The second is using store-bought puff pastry. And since this is a one-skillet affair,<br>
        there’s no pie plate, baking dish, Dutch oven, or food processor to clean. The results?<br>
        An easy take on a family favorite, with minimal prep time, that is, in fact, dinner party worthy.
    </p>

    <p>Know this about puff pastry: Letting it thaw overnight in the fridge is nonnegotiable. It’ll crack 
        and become a huge mess if it’s still partially frozen. This slightest bit of planning is the key to flaky pot pie<br>
        perfection.
    </p>        
        
    <p>You can make the cooked chicken mixture up to three days ahead—transfer it to an airtight container<br>
        and chill. When you’re ready to serve, assemble as instructed below, then slide the skillet into the oven<br>
        to brown the crust and reheat the pot pie filling.
    </p>
        
    <p>We like to brush the top of the dough with cream for this recipe, not egg wash, for a golden brown crust<br>
        with a rustic sheen (and because it saves us from using an extra ingredient). Cooking the pie on a tray<br>
        makes it easier to slide into the oven and catches any drippings. If your oven runs hot and the crust<br>
        starts to singe, very loosely cover it with foil for the last few minutes.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>6 Servings</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 2–3 lb. rotisserie chicken</li>
            <li>2 medium onions</li>
            <li>1 lb. turnips</li>
            <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. thyme leaves (from about 2 sprigs)</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2½ tsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li>1½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp. all-purpose flour, plus more for surface</li>
            <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream, divided</li>
            <li>1 10-oz. bag frozen peas</li>
            <li>1 14-oz. box puff pastry, thawed overnight</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
                Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 400°. Remove and discard skin of 1 rotisserie chicken, then<br>
                shred meat into 1" pieces (you should have 4–5 cups meat); set aside. You won't need the bones and<br>
                carcass from the chicken for this recipe, but that doesn't mean you should throw them out—sling them<br>
                into a saucepan, cover with water, add whatever aromatics you've got lying around, and you've got the<br>
                makings of a couple decent quarts of chicken stock.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
                Time to prep your vegetables! Cut 2 onions in half through root, trim root ends, then peel. Finely chop<br> 
                onion and transfer to a medium bowl.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
                Peel 1 lb. turnips, then trim off knobby root ends. Cut in half through the root end. Cut each half into<br>
                ¾"-thick planks, then finely chop planks into ¾" pieces. Transfer to another medium bowl.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
                Lightly smash 6 garlic cloves with the flat side of a chef’s knife. Peel, then coarsely chop. Transfer<br>
                to bowl with turnips.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
                Add 1 Tbsp. thyme leaves (from about 2 sprigs) to bowl with turnips and garlic.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
                Melt 3 Tbsp. butter in a 12" skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium heat. (Just make sure whatever<br> 
                you're using is oven-safe—you don't want a melting plastic handle.) Add onions and cook, stirring<br>
                occasionally, until very soft but not browned, 5–6 minutes.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
                Add turnip mixture, season with 1 tsp. salt and 1½ tsp. pepper, and cook, stirring often, until just<br>
                beginning to soften, 3 minutes.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
                Sprinkle 3 Tbsp. flour over vegetables and cook, stirring constantly, until flour begins to stick to bottom<br> 
                of pan, about 30 seconds. The flour is going to help thicken the gravy you're trying to create.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
                Add 1 cup wine and cook, stirring constantly, to burn off some of the alcohol, about 1 minute.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
                Set aside 1 Tbsp. cream. Add remaining cream, reserved chicken, 10 oz. peas, and 1½ tsp. salt and <br>
                bring to a simmer. Taste and adjust for seasoning. Cook, tossing occasionally, until warmed through, 3-4 minutes.<br> 
                Transfer skillet to a rimmed baking sheet, which will prevent any juices that bubble out of <br>
                the pan from spilling onto your oven floor.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
                Roll out 14 oz. puff pastry on a lightly floured surface into a 13" square (large enough to cover skillet<br>
                with a bit of overhang). Roll pastry up onto rolling pin. (You could use an empty wine bottle if you don't<br> 
                have a rolling pin.) Unfurl pastry from rolling pin, draping it over skillet.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
                Trim pastry so that there is a 1" border all around. Fold edge of puff pastry under itself. Crimp edges<br>
                with a fork (just like you would do when making the top crust of a pie).
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
                Using a pastry brush, brush top of pastry with reserved cream. Cut 5–6 small slits in the center so steam<br> 
                can escape. Bake pot pie until crust is light golden brown, 22–24 minutes.
            </li>

            <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">
                Reduce oven temperature to 350° and continue to bake until filling is bubbling around the edges and<br> 
                crust is well browned, 25–35 minutes longer. Let sit 10 minutes before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
